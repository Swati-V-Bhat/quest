      Just experienced the most unforgettable sunrise at the summit of Mount
      Batur in Bali! ðŸŒ„ We started the trek in the early hours of the morning,
      guided only by flashlights and the sound of crunching gravel beneath our
      feet. The climb was steep and challenging at times, especially in the
      darkness, but the anticipation of what was waiting at the top kept us

      mist-covered valleys and distant volcanic peaks. It was peaceful,
      powerful, and completely awe-inspiring.
